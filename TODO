create main class that will read input and produce output
	input: .txt file

	reads initial integer indicating the number of cases

	processes each case using subprocess

	output: .txt file

subprocess that examines a specific case
	input: search query, 2 dictionary words

	compare search query to word 1
	compare search query to word 2

	return: string --> word 1 or word 2 (whichever has a longer common sub-sequence)

method to find the longest common substring between two strings
	
	input: two strings

	finds the longest common subsequence between input strings

	definition: The longest common sub-sequence (lcss) between two strings is the longest sequence of characters that appear in both strings in the same order (but not necessarily consecutively).

	return: integer --> length of lcss
